### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four main components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command parser and executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.1.1 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
![Structure of the UI Component Further Elaborated](images/UiClassDiagramProfile.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CurrentPanelHeader`, `ResultDisplay`, `CommandBox`, `HelpWindow`, and the various `Panels`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

There are four different possible `Panels` and/or `PanelStates` :
* `StaffListPanel` : this is where the user can view the list of staffs in the database
* `ApplicantListPanel` : this is where the user can view the list of applicants in the database
* `StaffProfilePanel` : this is where the user can view the profile of a staff in the database
* `ApplicantProfilePanel` : this is where the user can view the profile of an applicant in the database

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Updates `GUISettings` so that lst viewed List Panel can be stored in `preferences.json`, an auto generated and updated file.

### 2.1.2 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `EvaParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a staff).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delstaff 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.1.3 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the staff and applicant data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Staff>` and an `ObservableList<Applicant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `CurrentViewStaff` and `CurrentViewApplicant` that can be 'observed' e.g the UI can be bound to object so that the UI automatically updates when the staff/applicant or it's attributes changes.
* does not depend on any of the other five components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `EvaStorage`, which `Person` references. This allows `EvaStorage` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 2.1.4 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Eva staff and applicant data in json format and read it back.

### 2.1.5 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `com.eva.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Staff Management System

#### 3.1.1 Leave System

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEvaStorage`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEvaStorage#commit()` — Saves the current eva database state in its history.
* `VersionedEvaStorage#undo()` — Restores the previous eva database state from its history.
* `VersionedEvaStorage#redo()` — Restores a previously undone eva database state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEvaStorage()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEvaStorage` will be initialized with the initial eva database state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single eva database state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the eva database. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitEvaStorage()`, causing the modified state of the eva database after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted eva database state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitEvaStorage()`, causing another modified eva database state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEvaStorage()`, so the eva database state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous eva database state, and restores the eva database to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial EvaStorage state, then there are no previous EvaStorage states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEvaStorage()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoEvaStorage()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the eva database to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `EvaStorageStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest eva database state, then there are no undone EvaStorage states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEvaStorage()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list s-`. Commands that do not modify the eva database, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEvaStorage()`, `Model#undoEvaStorage()` or `Model#redoEvaStorage()`. Thus, the `EvaStorageStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEvaStorage()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `EvaStorageStateList`, all eva database states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### 3.1.2 Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire eva database.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Target user profile**:

* works in small business/startup (5-30 headcount)
* can type fast
* prefers desktop apps over other types of apps
* prefers typing inputs compared to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Simple and lightweight application that handles HR related administrative tasks, like manage staff performance and recruitment applicants, faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
