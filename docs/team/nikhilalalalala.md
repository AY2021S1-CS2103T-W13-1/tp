Project: Eva <br>
Eva is a desktop HR management application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

New Features:
- Adding a staff record
  - What it does: allows user to add the record of a staff with the compulsory fields of Name, Email, Phone, Address.
  - Justification: This feature forms the foundation of our HR application as we need to store records that the user 
    adds.
- Adding an applicant record
  - What it does: allows user to add the record of a staff with the compulsory fields of Name, Email, Phone, Address
  - Justification: This feature forms the foundation of our HR application as we need to store records that the user
    adds.
  - Highlights: User can delay the input of Interview Date, so they can set an Interview date while adding an applicant
    or add that detail in later with the edit command. 
- Setting the application status of the applicant
  What it does: When adding an applicant, the status of the application is first set to received but in an actual
  scenario, there are many stages to an application, so this command helps user change the status of application
  in their records.
  Justification: This helps user track the status of various applicants.
