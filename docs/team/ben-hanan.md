## Project: Eva

Eva is a desktop HR management application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10000 Lines of Code.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
- Leave management
    - What it does: allows user add and delete leave records from a staff, auto updates total number of leave taken.
    - Justification: a leave management system allows users to keep track of their staff leaves.
    - Highlights: added leaves will be marked as "Approved", "Taken" or "On Current Leave" automatically based on the user's local time. 
- Viewing individual staff and applicant profiles and different lists.
    - What it does: allows user to view different pages of the app.
    - Justification: this feature makes the app less cluttered and gives users a better experience
    - Highlights: this allows the app to remember which page the user is on. So the next time the app is launched, it will launch into the appropriate page.
