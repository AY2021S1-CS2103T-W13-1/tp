## Project: Eva

Eva is a desktop **HR management application** built in the java language. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Eva was developed in semester 1 of AY20/21 as a team project in the NUS SOC module **CS2103T Software Engineering**.
Together with [my team](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w13-1.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html), we morphed the exiting java application
[Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) over a period of 7 weeks to what Eva is today.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
    - Leave management [#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/pull/51)
        - What it does: allows user add and delete leave records from a staff, auto updates total number of leave taken.
        - Justification: a leave management system allows users to keep track of their staff leaves.
        - Highlights: added leaves will be marked as "Approved", "Taken" or "On Current Leave" automatically based on the user's local time.
        - Non trivial pull requests: [#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/pull/51), [#62](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/pull/62), [#70](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/pull/70), [#215](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/pull/215)
    - Viewing individual staff and applicant profiles and different lists.
        - What it does: allows user to view different pages of the app.
        - Justification: this feature makes the app less cluttered and gives users a better experience
        - Highlights: this allows the app to remember which page the user is on. So the next time the app is launched, it will launch into the appropriate page.
